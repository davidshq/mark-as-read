# Mark as Read

Avoid wasting time rereading pages you've already read - mark them as done forever.

## How to Install

You'll need to be in Developer Mode.

## How to Use

Notice the new icon on the Chrome toolbar. 

![Image of unchecked page](https://github.com/edoreld/mark-as-read/blob/master/markasread/notvisited.png?raw=true)

When you tick it off, the item will look like the following:  

![Image of checked page](https://github.com/edoreld/mark-as-read/blob/master/markasread/icon_128.png?raw=true)

The extension will remember the "tick off state" for each page you visit and will show you the right image when you come back.

If you click on the extension icon, it will change from unchecked to checked or vice versa.
